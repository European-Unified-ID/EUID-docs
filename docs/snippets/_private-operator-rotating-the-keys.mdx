Here are some guidelines for keeping your operator key secure:

- When you receive your operator key, store it in a secure location.
- Keep track of all places where the key is used, so that if you need to rotate it you can do so quickly.
- Establish a process for replacing the existing value with a new one if the key is compromised.
- Rotate it on a regular cadence&#8212;for example, yearly&#8212;to help reduce the risk of the key being compromised.
