To add Prebid.js to your site, follow the instructions in [Getting Started for Developers](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/getting-started.html) in the Prebid.js documentation. 

When you download the Prebid.js package, add the EUID module by checking the box next to the module named **European Unified ID**, listed under the section **User ID Modules**.

When you've added Prebid.js to your site and confirmed that it's working properly, you're ready to configure the EUID module.

:::tip
To make sure that the EUID module is installed, find the string `euidIdSystem` in the [`pbjs.installedModules` array](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/publisher-api-reference/installedModules.html).
