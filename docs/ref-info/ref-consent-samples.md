# Consent Samples

The following consent samples are intended to provide examples of wording that publishers, advertisers, or data providers could use as a basis for requesting user consent for EUID.

:::note
These samples are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute legal advice.
:::

Consent language examples are in these sections:

- [EUID Consent Example Included as Part of CMP/Cookie Consent Overlay](#euid-consent-example-included-as-part-of-cmpcookie-consent-overlay)
- [Standalone EUID Consent](#standalone-euid-consent)

## EUID Consent Example Included as Part of CMP/Cookie Consent Overlay

The following consent sample provides suggestions for wording you could include as part of a CMP/cookie consent overlay, to request your users' consent for EUID. It includes:

- [Primary Overlay](#primary-overlay)
- [Second-Layer Introductory Language (in the "Customize Options" Link)](#second-layer-introductory-language-in-the-customize-options-link)

### Primary Overlay

The following table includes consent sample copy for the primary overlay.

| Content Type | Consent Language |
| --- | --- |
| Consent to EUID identifier<br/>**Learn more** should link to the Participant's privacy policy which contains further links to the [EUID Privacy Notice](https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy) and the [EUID Transparency and Control Portal](https://transparentadvertising.eu/). | Where we have your email address, we and The Trade Desk (our advertising partner) will use it to create a unique advertising identifier (the EUID). Your identifier will be encrypted and shared with different sites and advertisers who may, subject to your choices, use it to show you personalized ads.<br/>**Learn more** |
| TCF purposes | We and our partners will store and/or access information on your device and will use the unique advertising identifier and other personal information for personalized ads (creating and using profiles for personalized ads), ad measurement, audience insights, and to develop and improve our products. To do this, personal information may be used to match and combine offline data sources. |
| Optional value language | If you do not consent, less of your personal information will be used, and so the ads shown to you might not be as relevant to you and your interests, generating less revenue to support content you view and enjoy on the internet (such as online newspapers). |
| Mandatory consent lead-in. Withdrawal of consent language may be refined (links to the [EUID Transparency and Control Portal](https://transparentadvertising.eu/) / further information concerning data subject rights). | To see more detail and make granular choices, choose **Customize Options**. You can withdraw consent at any time. |
| Consent buttons | <ul><li>Yes to all</li><li>No to all</li><li>Customize options</li></ul> |
