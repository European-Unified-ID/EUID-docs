# Consent Samples

(**GWH_EP_01: Shall I add in links to glossary entries (EUID or any others)?**)
(**GWH_EP_02: Note I've preserved the English spelling here although in general the site content is in US English. For example, "customise" rather than "customize" in the wording.**)

The following samples of consent language are intended to help xxx and xxx to xxx.

:::note
These samples are provided for informational purposes only, and do not constitute legal advice.
:::

Consent language examples are in these sections:

- [Examples for the Primary Overlay](#examples-for-the-primary-overlay)
- [Standalone Content](#standalone-content)

## Examples for the Primary Overlay

The following samples of consent language provide suggestions for wording you could include as part of CMP/cookie consent overlay, to inform your users regarding EUID and to request consent for EUID from your users.

| Content Type | Consent Language |
| --- | --- |
| Consent to EUID identifier<br/>**Learn more** should link to the Participant's privacy policy which contains further links to the [EUID Privacy Notice](https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy) and the [EUID Transparency and Control Portal](https://transparentadvertising.eu/). | Where we have your email address, we and The Trade Desk (our advertising partner) will use it to create a unique advertising identifier (the EUID). Your identifier will be encrypted and shared with different sites and advertisers who may, subject to your choices, use it to show you personalised ads.<br/>**Learn more** (link) |
| TCF purposes | We and our partners will store and/or access information on your device and will use the unique advertising identifier and other personal information for personalised ads (creating and using profiles for personalised ads), ad measurement, audience insights, and to develop and improve our products. To do this, personal information may be used to match and combine offline data sources. |
| Optional value language | If you do not consent, less of your personal information will be used, and so the ads shown to you might not be as relevant to you and your interests, generating less revenue to support content you view and enjoy on the internet (such as online newspapers). |
| Mandatory consent lead-in. Withdrawal of consent language may be refined (links to the [EUID Transparency and Control Portal](https://transparentadvertising.eu/) / data subject right discussion) (**GWH_EP_03 what does "data subject right discussion" mean?**) | To see more detail and make granular choices, choose **Customise Options**. You can withdraw consent at any time.<br/><br/>For additional wording suggestions, see [Second-Layer Language for the "Customise Options" link](#second-layer-language-for-the-customise-options-link). |
| Consent buttons | <ul><li>Yes to all</li><li>No to all</li><li>Customise options</li></ul> |

##  Second-Layer Language for the "Customise Options" link

This section offers examples of more detailed language you could consider using for content offered to users who click the **Customise Options** link.

(**GWH_EP_04 not sure if the two bullets are intended to be consecutive, or alternative options?**)

- We and our partners store or access information on devices, such as cookies, and process personal information for the purposes described below. Where we have your email address, we and The Trade Desk (our advertising partner) will use it to create a unique advertising identifier (the EUID), which, subject to your choices, may then be used for the purposes described below.(**GWH_EP_05 we use "below" twice here. I'd prefer to link to the exact section we want to refer to. Not sure what it is though. Recommendations? Same thing in the next sample. In docs we try not to use above and below... and because this is legal we should be as specific as poss I think?**)
- You can customise your consent choices for the use of cookies and your personal information for the specific purposes listed below. Click **Yes to all** or **No to all**, or use the toggles to turn some choices on and off. Some processing of your personal information might not require your consent, but you have the right to object to such processing. You can also withdraw or change your consent preferences at any time.

## Standalone EUID Consent

The following samples of consent language could be used on an existing page where the user's email is collected: for example, on a login/sign-up page or on an email marketing sign-up page:

(**GWH_EP_06 it would be nice to have a one-liner to more clearly say what's different about each one... if possible. Not necessary.**)
